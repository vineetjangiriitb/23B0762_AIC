I am Vineet Jangir from first year Civil department. I am eager to join the artificial
intelligence community because I am enthusiastic about the potential of future AI
systems. I am keen to learn more about how these systems can be developed to
maximize their usefulness and impact. I want to be a part of an AI community to get
involved in more exciting projects and challenges which can help us delve deeper
into the understanding of how these systems work. The prospect of joining such a
vibrant community excites and motivates me. I am eager to learn from this dynamic
environment and look forward to collaborating with like-minded and intelligent
individuals. I have been studying machine learning since January and have completed
several courses on Coursera, including the Machine Learning Specialization from
Deeplearning.ai. I am proficient in Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and Arduino coding. I
have participated in various hackathons and competitions, such as an algorithmic
trading competition and Energenius (an AI/ML competition). Additionally, I
competed in an AI/ML grand challenge(GC) where my team developed a disease
detection model and we were among the top 10 teams. I have also taken part in one
AI/ML Image matching challenge competition in which we have to make 3D spatial
models from 2D images and currently working on that. I am excited to work in the
community and hoping for some exciting and cool projects ahead.
