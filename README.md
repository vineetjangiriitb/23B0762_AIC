Detailed discussion on the performance of your model
I had trained my model on pre-trained Tensorflow hub FasterRCNN+InceptionResNetV2 model which is trained on Open Images V4, containing 600 classes, and modified the final layers of the model. It outputs the following features 
detection_boxes: aÂ tf.float32Â tensor of shapeÂ [N, 4]Â containing bounding box coordinates in the following order:Â [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax].
detection_class_entities: aÂ tf.stringÂ tensor of shapeÂ [N]Â containing detection class names as Freebase MIDs.
detection_class_names: aÂ tf.stringÂ tensor of shapeÂ [N]Â containing human-readable detection class names.
detection_class_labels: aÂ tf.int64Â tensor of shapeÂ [N]Â with class indices.
detection_scores: aÂ tf.float32Â tensor of shapeÂ [N]Â containing detection scores.
Its Precision is 0.75, Recall is 1.0 and mAPis 0.5555555555555556 on test set of randomly chosen images from google. 

Challenges faced during model implementation and training phase: 

There were a lot of challenges when I was working on making the model. I was initially following some more complex strategies in which I was using Pascal VOC dataset and thought of first labelling all the images and then building some models for object detection from scratch in which I was trying to use the Imageset and annotation files files for object detection. Then after initial struggles and significant time investment, I thought of trying to instead find a suitable pre trained model for object detection model and then fine tuning it to get the required results. It also required significant efforts to calculate various metrics which were asked to do which I eventually did using the confidence scores of image detection and manually finding true labels for the images as the dataset consisted of randomly selected google images. Finding right sources for getting related information was also a task as even ChatGPT sucks at various places in thisðŸ˜…. Overall the project was a great learning experience and truly enjoyed doing it.

Some improvements and alternative approaches:

It is still not a highly accurate model and training with more data can help in increasing its performance metrics and overall working. Performing extensive hyperparameter tuning, including learning rates, anchor box scales, and aspect ratios, to find the optimal settings for the model.  Model pruning and quantization can also be applied to reduce model size and improve inference speed without substantial loss in accuracy.
Model can also be modified to even detect objects in moving video objects which is also important in some of real world tasks.
